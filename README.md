# Docker and Kubernetes Web Application Deployment

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to package a web application with a MongoDB database into a Docker container and deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. This setup is ideal for development and testing purposes, allowing you to simulate a production Kubernetes environment on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Homebrew** (for macOS users): [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Basic knowledge of **Docker** and **Kubernetes** concepts

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker

You can download Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### 2. Install Minikube

For macOS users, Minikube can be installed using Homebrew:

brew install minikube
For other operating systems, refer to the official Minikube documentation.

### 3. Configure Minikube Driver
We'll use Docker as the driver for Minikube. Start Minikube with the Docker driver:
minikube start --driver=docker

## Usage

### Check Minikube Status

To verify the status of Minikube:
minikube status

### Check Kubernetes Nodes
Minikube includes kubectl as a dependency. To check the status of all nodes:
kubectl get nodes

## Kubernetes Configuration Files
You’ll need to create the following Kubernetes configuration files:

ConfigMap: Define MongoDB endpoint configuration.
Secret: Store MongoDB username and password securely.
MongoDB Deployment: Configuration file for deploying MongoDB with an internal service for in-cluster communication.
Web Application Deployment: Configuration file for deploying the web application with an external service for external access.

For syntax and examples of these configuration files, refer to the Kubernetes Documentation.

## Docker Image
The Docker image of the web application is pulled from Docker Hub. Ensure the image is specified correctly in your Kubernetes deployment configuration files.

## Accessing the Application
Once the deployments are configured and running, you can access the web application by using the Minikube service command:

minikube service <service-name>

Replace <service-name> with the name of the service defined in your web application’s deployment configuration.

This setup allows us to simulate a Kubernetes production environment locally, making it easier to develop and test containerized applications before deploying them in production.
